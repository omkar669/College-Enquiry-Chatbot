# College-Enquiry-Chatbot
College Enquiry Chat bot is simple web application which aims to provide the information
regarding college. The information can be in the form of teachers or student’s GPA or the
various activities in the college. It can be an upgraded form of our college’s webkiosk.
After some improvements and some additions this project can be fully embedded into the
working site of the college.
The chatbot created here is a web based application which used Natural Language
Processing Libraries and Artificial Intelligence Markup Language to have conversations
with humans. “Eliza” and “Cleverbot” are some of the web applications which have been
created in the past. Like “Eliza”, the responses of this chatbot are programmed up to some
extent. This is because of the fact that it is a simple bot which answers the queries
regarding the college. Since the curriculum of the college keeps on changing, there has
to be database which can be edited and upgraded from time to time.
So far, what I have achieved is a sample program which processes the response of the
users by using simple parsing and substituting them into premade templates. It also uses
hardcoded phrases so that the conversation is continued.
In the future, NLP can be implemented to understand what a user is saying and give the
solutions to his problems. Natural Language Processing is a field of computer science
sub- branchartificial intelligence which is concerned with interactions between computer
and humans. Some the field inside NLP are Natural Language Understanding(NLU) and
Natural Language Generation(NLG).
